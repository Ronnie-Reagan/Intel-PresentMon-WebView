# Intel PresentMon Web Viewer

Welcome to the Intel PresentMon Web Viewer, a collaborative browser‑based interface for visualizing and analyzing PresentMon performance data.

By hosting the viewer locally on **port 3000**, you can share access with colleagues—enabling real‑time, remote collaboration for faster bottleneck identification and problem‑solving. To grant external access, configure port‑forwarding for **TCP 3000** on your router or firewall; exercise caution and adhere to your organization’s security policies when exposing services to the Internet.
